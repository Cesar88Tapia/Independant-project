  <h1><strong>My projects</strong></h1>
  <h2>Here is a list of projects that I have worked on. Such as:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cookie Recipe</li>
    <li>Hello-world</li>
    <li>my-favorite-dog</li>
    <li>Pitbull-web</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the Cookie Recipe exercise, I had to fix the indentation, in order for it to look better for the website, and it used the HTML language. On the Hello-world exercise I learned to use the terminal, like how to create a folder and a file like .html.
    With my-favorite-dog project, I learn to create a web page. And for Pitbull-web, is a web project that I created after learning how to use the language CSS. Up to now all my projects have HTML and CSS languages </p>

  <p>When I came back to Mexico, I entered the call center life, I started working in Telvista, for Western Union, making money transfers, then I worked at TeleTech, for Dish Network, helping customers with their programing, and making payments, after that
    I went to work at Sykes, for a company from Texas called BeautiControl helping customers make orders of make up, then I saw a better opportunity working at CCSI for Than Merrill, scheduling real state workshops, so people could learn how to sale houses,
    then I went back to Sykes to work for Ally a company for car loans, I was on the collections deparment, I had to take payments and call customers when they were late on their payments. My last job was at HCC working on behalf of Verizon FiOS for business,
    I had to call small businesses and schedule appointment so that they could recieve a free quote, then Verizon stopped working with us and HCC started working for Comcast for business, I had to do almost the same thing of scheduling appointments but
    this time I had to prepare the quote and try to convince the customer to buy Comcast service, it did not work well for me so that is why I decided to quit and join the Hola Code program. The main reason that I decided to become a programer is because
    I got tired of call centers and I did not wanted to be stuck in that life that did not have any future, nor for me or my family, but now that I am becoming a developer I can see that I can provide better for my family, and try to help others as much
    as I can.</p>
  <h4>Dedicated to My Dad, who still lives in the US, and is supporting me get through the program</h4>
  <h5>Thank you very much for your support, <em>I LOVE YOU DAD!</em> </h5>
