  <h1><strong>My projects</strong></h1>
  <h2>Here is a list of projects that I have worked on. Such as:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cookie Recipe</li>
    <li>Hello-world</li>
    <li>my-favorite-dog</li>
    <li>Pitbull-web</li>
</ul>
  <p>For the Cookie Recipe exercise, I had to fix the indentation, in order for it to look better for the website, and it
    used the HTML language. On the Hello-world exercise I learned to use the terminal, like how to
  create a folder and a file like .html. With my-favorite-dog project, I learn to create a web page.
And for Pitbull-web, is a web project that I created after learning how to use the language CSS. Up to now all my projects have HTML and CSS languages </p>

<p>After I graduated and went to James Monroe Highschool, I entered a program called jROTC, which was a military program to encourage
students to enlist with the US Army.</p>

<p>When I graduated highscool, I started working so that I would be able to help my dad with rent, food, and bills, my first job was in Target
for the next 3 years, accomodating boxes at the back room, after I quit, I started working at a factory for pipes, bongs, and vaporizers
called Funky Fish, I worked ther for 5 monts, in the shipping department, then I quit and came back to Mexico</p>

<p>When I came back to Mexico, I entered the call center life, I started working in Telvista, for Western Union, making money transfers, then I worked at
TeleTech, for Dish Network, helping customers with their programing, and making payments, after that I went to work at Sykes, for a company from Texas called BeautiControl
helping customers make orders of make up, then I saw a better opportunity working at CCSI for Than Merrill, scheduling real state workshops, so people could learn how
to sale houses, then I went back to Sykes to work for Ally a company for car loans, I was on the collections deparment, I had to take payments and call customers when they
were late on their payments. My last job was at HCC working on behalf of Verizon FiOS for business, I had to call small businesses and schedule appointment so that they
could recieve a free quote, then Verizon stopped working with us and HCC started working for Comcast for business, I had to do almost the same thing of scheduling appointments
but this time I had to prepare the quote and try to convince the customer to buy Comcast service, it did not work well for me so that is why I decided to quit and join the Hola Code program.
The main reason that I decided to become a programer is because I got tired of call centers and I did not wanted to be stuck in that life that did not have any future, nor for me or my family,
 but now that I am becoming a developer I can see that I can provide better for my family, and try to help others as much as I can.</p>
<h4>Dedicated to My Dad, who still lives in the US, and is supporting me get through the program</h4>
<h5>Thank you very much for your support, <em>I LOVE YOU DAD!</em> </h5>
