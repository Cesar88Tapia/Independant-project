  <h1>My projects</h1>
  <h2>Here is a list of projects that I have worked on. Such as:</h2>
  <li>Cookie Recipe</li>
  <li>Hello-world</li>
  <li>my-favorite-dog</li>
  <li>Pitbull-web</li>
  <p>For the Cookie Recipe exercise, I had to fix the indentation, in order for it to look better for the website, and it
    used the HTML language. On the Hello-world exercise I learned to use the terminal, like how to
  create a folder and a file like .html. With my-favorite-dog project, I learn to create a web page.
And for Pitbull-web, is a web project that I created after learning how to use the language CSS. Up to now all my projects have HTML and CSS languages </p>
